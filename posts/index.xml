&lt;p&gt;For some (including myself) it isn&amp;rsquo;t a conscious decision, but rather something that happens by accident.
It can be defined by the company you work for, your own interests, skillset or the skills of others that you work alongside.
Either way, you make the choice or it is made for you. Both are fine, but its up to the individual to take control of that choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
