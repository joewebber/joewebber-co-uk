It can be defined by the company you work for, your own interests, skillset or the skills of others that you work alongside.
Either way, you make the choice or it is made for you. Both are fine, but its up to the individual to take control of that choice.</p><h2 id=my-own-path>My Own Path</h2><p>To explain this in more detail, I will speak mostly from my own experience.</p><p>Prior to my career as a Developer, I was more interested in design. When starting to learn coding, it was a means to an end to create well-designed user interfaces. I was not particularly interested in learning
languages in great detail, but more in gaining just enough knowledge to create the ideas in my head. Through the course of my career, I&rsquo;ve worked with multiple languages on frontend, backend and cloud projects, but my goal has always been the same: learn enough to do the thing I need to do. Prototyping ideas, developing solutions and architecting systems is where I find the most reward, which lends itself more naturally to a career as a Manager. This was something I discovered by accident, but this doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.</p><h2 id=the-people-vs-project-dilemma>The People vs. Project Dilemma</h2><p>Ultimately, at some point in your career, the choice between people or project management will come up. The question is, do you want to focus on developing software or developing people?</p><p>For those who choose to develop software, the path often leads toward specialisation. Becoming an expert in a particular language, platform, or paradigm. You might find joy in deep diving into code, solving complex technical challenges, and becoming the go-to person for tough problems. You&rsquo;ll likely still collaborate, mentor, and influence, but your core value is your technical skillset and how you apply it.</p><p>On the other hand, if you find yourself more drawn to team dynamics, planning, and helping others succeed, then people management may be the more fulfilling route. It doesn&rsquo;t mean leaving tech behind, it means using your technical experience to guide and support others. Success becomes less about what you build, and more about what your team achieves.</p><h2 id=shaping-your-own-direction>Shaping Your Own Direction</h2><p>Neither path is more valuable than the other. What matters is aligning your work with what energises you. That might mean stepping away from code entirely, or doubling down on it. It might mean becoming a tech lead, a mentor, an architect, a Head of Engineering, or none of those.</p><p>The key is not to let the choice happen in the background. Reflect, ask questions, and try things. Talk to people in roles that interest you. Ask for responsibilities that stretch you in the direction you&rsquo;re curious about. You don&rsquo;t need to have it all figured out, but you do owe it to yourself to explore intentionally.</p><p>Because whether you write code or lead people, your career is something you get to shape.</p></div></article></main><footer class=footerContainer><p>&copy; 2025 Joe Webber</p><ul class=list><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-webber-18254b16/><svg width="48" height="48" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0H5C2.239.0.0 2.239.0 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762.0 5-2.239 5-5V5c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zM8 19H5V8h3v11zM6.5 6.732c-.966.0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zM20 19h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0V19h-3V8h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476V19z"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/joewebber><svg width="48" height="48" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0H5C2.239.0.0 2.239.0 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762.0 5-2.239 5-5V5c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zm-4.466 19.59c-.405.078-.534-.171-.534-.384v-2.195c0-.747-.262-1.233-.55-1.481 1.782-.198 3.654-.875 3.654-3.947.0-.874-.312-1.588-.823-2.147.082-.202.356-1.016-.079-2.117.0.0-.671-.215-2.198.82-.64-.18-1.324-.267-2.004-.271-.68.003-1.364.091-2.003.269-1.528-1.035-2.2-.82-2.2-.82-.434 1.102-.16 1.915-.077 2.118-.512.56-.824 1.273-.824 2.147.0 3.064 1.867 3.751 3.645 3.954-.229.2-.436.552-.508 1.07-.457.204-1.614.557-2.328-.666.0.0-.423-.768-1.227-.825.0.0-.78-.01-.055.487.0.0.525.246.889 1.17.0.0.463 1.428 2.688.944v1.489c0 .211-.129.459-.528.385C6.292 18.533 4 15.534 4 12c0-4.419 3.582-8 8-8s8 3.581 8 8c0 3.533-2.289 6.531-5.466 7.59z"/></svg></a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
