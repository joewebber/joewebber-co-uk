Hi, I'm Joe - a Product and Technology leader based in Exeter, UK. I've spent a large portion of my career in hands-on management roles, both working on code and leading teams of Developers and Engineers.

My interests include (but are not limited to) platform engineering, product strategy, scaling teams and companies, developer experience, music, sport.

On this site you'll find [posts](/posts) (short, social media style writing/media or links) and [articles](articles) (long form writing, less frequent). I add content about anything that interests me.
