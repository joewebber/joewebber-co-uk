Hi, I'm Joe.

When I was young and searching for a career direction, I discovered I like building things and putting them on the Internet. You can see my first ever attempt (online from around 1999-2002) [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20091027003738/http://uk.geocities.com/Joewebber1000/CZM.htm).

I started off building websites and moved on to web applications. Since then, I've made a career out of organising people to build websites and applications that other people need.

On this site you'll find [posts](/posts) (short, social media style writing/media or links) and [articles](articles) (long form writing, less frequent).
