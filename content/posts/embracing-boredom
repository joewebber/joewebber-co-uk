In order to be productive, you need to be doing a lot of things.

I used to believe this was the case, but I was wrong. Slowing down and doing less actually makes you more productive.

Think of your mind like a web browser. The more tabs you have open, the more memory and energy is used up. If you open more tabs during your "rest" time (e.g looking at the news) you are just opening more tabs.

Embracing boredom during your rest time will help you focus more when its time to work. You might find you get more done in less time.

I have a lot of practice and learning to do on this. Switching off from my phone more is my first step.
