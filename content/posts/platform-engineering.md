Platform Engineering is a term I've only heard recently. It outlines the process of creating self-serve Developer tooling, aimed at reducing DevOps friction and enhancing existing workflows.

I've been digging into it heavily for the last year and it aligns really well with something I've been passionate about for a lot longer: making Developers working lives easier.

There are so many inefficiencies in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Whether its process, documentation or tooling, there's a lot of improvements to be made. Even with the recent rise of AI tools, these challenges haven't disappeared. AI adoption has added a further challenges.

Platform Engineering is about putting the needs of the customer (Developers) first. Having a dedicated team or individual in a company whose function it is to act as Product Manager(s) for an IDP (Internal Developer Platform), and who drives a "Platform as a Product" methodology.
