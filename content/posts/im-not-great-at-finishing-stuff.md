I'm not great at finishing stuff.

This is one of the reasons I'm a better leader/manager than I am an IC. My strength is in thinking, coming up with ideas and designing an approach to tackle a problem.

Being good at outlining an idea and enabling teams to execute around that idea is a positive leadership quality. So, being bad at finishing stuff is actually an asset.

Think about that for a minute.

What "weaknesses" do you have that you can turn into strengths?
