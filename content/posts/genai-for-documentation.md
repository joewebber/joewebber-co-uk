title: GenAI for documentation

In my view, one of the best applications of GenAI is for organisational knowledge. 

In theory, you should be able to speed up company onboarding massively by getting knowledge out of people's heads and into an organised system of context for an LLM to consume.

The main drawback is this requires commitment, time and dedication to a task that not many people like doing: writing clear documentation.

That's the trick. One of the keys to operational efficiency has always been access to good documentation.
