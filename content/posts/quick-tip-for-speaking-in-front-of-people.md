Quick tip for speaking in front of people for overthinking introverts.

It's often said that it's helpful to do a lot of preparation and practice when writing a talk, presentation or speech. This can be helpful, but it can also be a hindrance.

Over-preparation (in my opinion) can lead to anxiety around the content of your talk. Having a strong grasp of the topic and some notes might serve you better.

Disclaimer: this is my own experience as an overthinker. Results may vary.
