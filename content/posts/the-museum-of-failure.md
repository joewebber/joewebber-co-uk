There is a museum that started in Sweden called the "Museum of Failure".

From their website:

"Museum of Failure is a collection of failed products and services from around the world.

Innovation needs failure. All progress is built on learning from past failures and mistakes. The museum provides unique insight into the tricky business of innovation.

Learning is the only way to turn failure into success."

This is a quick reminder that failure means progress if you learn from it.

It's ok to fail.
