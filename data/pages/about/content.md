Hi, I'm Joe - a Software Engineer turned Engineering Manager based in Exeter, UK. I've spent a large portion of my career in hands-on management roles, both working on code and leading compact teams of Developers and Engineers.

These days, I spend less time debugging JavaScript and more time debugging team dynamics, delivery pipelines, and sometimes... myself.

This blog is where I share what I've learned (and am still learning) about leadership in tech - the good, the messy, and the surprisingly relatable. Whether you're just stepping into management or deep in the weeds, I hope my reflections on building teams, scaling systems, and managing people help you feel a little less alone and a little more empowered.
