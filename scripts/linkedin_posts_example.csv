2025-04-15,Understanding Leadership in Tech,"Leadership in technology isn't just about managing people—it's about creating an environment where innovation thrives.

When I think about what makes great tech leaders, I always come back to three core principles:

1. **Empowerment Over Control**: Great leaders don't micromanage. They create frameworks that allow their teams to make decisions confidently.

2. **Technical Credibility**: You don't need to be the best coder in the room, but you need to understand the challenges your team faces and respect the complexity of their work.

3. **Vision With Flexibility**: Have a clear direction, but be willing to adapt when you learn something new.

The best leaders I've worked with combine these elements naturally. They're comfortable with uncertainty, honest about what they don't know, and always focused on removing blockers for their teams.

2025-03-20,The Power of Side Projects,"Side projects have been instrumental in my career growth, and here's why I believe every developer should consider having one.

It's not about the hustle or working 24/7—it's about having a sandbox where you can experiment without constraints. In your day job, you have deadlines, stakeholders, and technical debt. In a side project, you have freedom.

Some of the most valuable skills I've learned came from projects that never made a penny:
- Testing new frameworks without production pressure
- Learning deployment and DevOps hands-on
- Understanding the full product lifecycle
- Making mistakes that taught me more than any success

The goal isn't to create the next unicorn startup. The goal is learning by doing, on your own terms.
