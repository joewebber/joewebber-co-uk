Hi, I'm Joe - a Software Engineer turned Engineering Manager based in Exeter, UK. I've spent a large portion of my career in hands-on management roles, both working on code and leading compact teams of Developers and Engineers.

Nowadays, I'm more of a strategic tech leader focused on business goals, building and scaling teams and helping Developers/Engineers with their career progression.
